=============

Mining MTA data feeds for interesting statistics and representation through data visualization. 

I am looking to analyze the extensive data provided by the MTA about routes, trips, subway stops, and turnstile usage to obtain
useful information the key charactertistics of the service and passenger distributions at various times and locations and travel
directions.  I am confident this will provde some interesting insights into how the public transport system operates and
how people use it.
